## API for AI Agents

SpecBase provides a REST API designed for AI agent integration:

### Discovery
- `GET /api/v1/categories` — List all product categories with counts
- `GET /api/v1/manufacturers` — List manufacturers, optionally filtered by category

### Search
- `POST /api/v1/search` — Structured search with spec filters and facets
- `GET /api/v1/search?q=...` — Simple text search

### Products
- `GET /api/v1/products?category=motors&q=5hp` — List products (filter required)
- `GET /api/v1/products/{id}` — Full product with all specifications

### Crossover / Reverse Lookup
- `POST /api/v1/crossover` — Find equivalent products from other manufacturers

### Comparison
- `POST /api/v1/compare` — Compare 2-5 products side by side

### OpenAPI Specification
- `GET /api/v1/openapi` — Full OpenAPI 3.1 spec (JSON)

## Rate Limits

- General API: 30 requests/minute
- Product endpoints: 10 requests/minute
- Max 20 results per page, max 25 pages (500 products per query)
- Full specifications only available on individual product endpoints

## Recommended Agent Workflow

1. Call `GET /api/v1/categories` to discover product types
2. Call `POST /api/v1/search` with category + spec filters to find products
3. Call `GET /api/v1/products/{id}` for full specs on selected products
4. Call `POST /api/v1/crossover` to find alternatives from other manufacturers
5. Call `POST /api/v1/compare` to compare shortlisted products side by side
